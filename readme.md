# Description
This repository contains Python scripts for Blender that will fix rigs ripped from `Risk of Rain 2`.
The main usage for this is creating skins with custom models for vanilla characters.

You can read the guide on how to use these scripts [here](https://github.com/KingEnderBrine/-RoR2-BlenderScripts/wiki)
